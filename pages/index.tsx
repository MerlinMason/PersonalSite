                I&apos;m passionate about building the teams, processes and software that create
                amazing digital products.

            <p>
                I have a T-shaped skill set with a deep understanding of the frontend stack and a
                broad understanding of product design and UX, backend engineering, devops and
                infrastructure, project and people management, business operations, security and
                compliance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most recently (2014 - 2021), I co-founded and led engineering at Mo, building a 12
                strong engineering team and a product used by 100,000 users from scratch. With a
                small team we created a product that would often win over industry incumbents
                (Yammer, Reward Gateway, Perkbox etc) in sales processes.
