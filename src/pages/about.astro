                    Hi, I'm Merlin, a frontend-leaning fullstack product engineer. I have {
                        currentYear - 2009
                    } years experience, in startups, scale-ups and as an entrepreneur. I've developed
                    a T-shaped skill set with a deep understanding of the frontend stack and a broad
                    understanding of product design and UX, backend engineering, devops and infrastructure,
                    business operations, security and compliance. I'm passionate about building user
                    centric digital products that are delightful to use and deliver measurable business
                    impact.
