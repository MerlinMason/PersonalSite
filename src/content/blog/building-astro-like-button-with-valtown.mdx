There's a lot of excitement currently around [Val.Town](https://val.town/) so I
thought I'd check it out and see what it's all about. I thought it would be cool
to add a like button to my [Astro](https://astro.build) blog posts as this is
suitably low risk and effort but significant enough that it throws up some real
world challenges and allows us to test the Val.Town platform.

## What is Val.Town?

Val.Town is a social platform that allows you to write and share snippets
(either JSON or functions) of code with low friction. It's sort of similar to a
GitHub Gist but with several significant improvements:

1. You can run the code you write in the browser.
2. When you save a Val (snippet) it is instantly deployed as a serverless
   function that can be accessed via a URL.
3. When you save a Val it is instantly published to an internal registry,
   meaning other Vals can use it as a dependency. This makes composability and
   sharing code in the community very easy.

They have great introduction to what Vals are and how to use them in the
[Val.Town docs](https://docs.val.town/vals).

## What is Astro?

Astro is the framework this blog is built on, it's a static site generator that
implements the
[Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). It's
entirely pre-generated at build time and has no backend.

## What are we building?

A like button! You've probably seen one before. Let's define some requirements:

-   The like button should appear on the bottom of every blog post
-   It should display the count of likes per post
-   It should enable a reader to like a post without having to authenticate
-   It should prevent a reader from liking a post more than once
-   We should take reasonable steps to prevent from spam and abuse

## API design

From the requirements I think we're going to need two API endpoints.

`GET /likes/:slug` to get the number of likes for a given blogpost slug. However
there's a limitation of Val.Town that we can't use dynamic routes like this, so
instead we'll use a query parameter like this: `GET /likes?postSlug=example`.
This feels slightly less RESTful, but it's not a big deal.

`POST /likes` to increment the number of likes for a given blogpost slug. This
time we'll include the `postSlug` in the body of the request.

## User identification

We need to identify users so we can prevent them from liking a post more than
once. Let's look at the options:

1. **❌ User accounts** - We could create user accounts and require
   authentication, this is the most robust solution but it's also the most
   friction for the user and added implementation time for us.
2. **❌ Cookies** - We could use a cookie to identify users, this is quick to
   implement but less robust as users can clear their cookies or switch to
   incognito mode. It also means writing a cookie policy and having an annoying
   cookie banner, ain't nobody got time for that.
3. **✅ Fingerprinting** - Use a
   [device fingerprinting library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%2540fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs),
   this is quick to implement and is reasonably reliable to uniquely identify
   devices. It works across incognito and normal browsing modes and clearing the
   cache doesn't affect it. Additionally when using it for the purposes of
   adapting a user interface
   [it's exempt](https://www.iubenda.com/blog/device-fingerprinting-and-cookie-law/)
   from requiring user consent or a privacy policy. This is the option we'll go
   with. We can send the fingerprint as a header in the request to our API like
   so `Authorization: Bearer <fingerprint>`.

## Persisting likes

Val.Town has several options for persisting data with third party services such
as Upstash, Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale etc. All of these seem overkill for our
requirements. They also offer a SQLite instance you can access via WASM which
looks cool but really I think we can settle with the simplest option of
persisting state in a Val itself as a simple Key/Value store. This currently has
a limit of 100kb per Val which roughly gives me space for storing 3000 likes.
This blog has very limited traffic so I think we'll be fine, and will be a nice
problem to have in the future if we ever get to that point.

```json
{
    "example-post-slug": ["fingerprint1", "fingerprint2"]
}
```

## Preventing spam and abuse

This is somewhat tricky in a world where we don't have user accounts. We want to
take a defence in depth approach, layering protections to give us the best
chance of preventing abuse. Let's look at the (albeit limited) options:

1. **✅ Rate limiting** - We can limit the number of requests per IP address in
   a given time frame. This is a good first line of defence but it's not
   foolproof as attackers can use proxies to get around it.
2. **✅ Restrict domains** - In theory we could use CORS to limit the domains
   that can make requests to our API. Unfortunately while Val.Town uses
   Express.js, you cannot use the CORS middleware. We can however check the
   `Origin` header to ensure it matches this domain. It's worth noting that
   while you cannot spoof the `Origin` header in a browser, you can spoof it
   using `curl` or other HTTP clients, this limitation is also true of CORS.
3. **✅ Input validation** - We can validate the input to our API to ensure it's
   what we expect. We can validate the slug is in fact a valid slug from our
   blog and that the fingerprint is a 32 character string. Fingerprints could
   still be fabricated but it limits the damage of spam.
4. **❌ Captcha** - We could use a captcha to ensure the request is coming from
   a real user. Realistically this is overkill for a like button and would
   create too much friction for the user.

## Val.Town implementation

#### POST /likes

Ok, let's get started! First we'll create a new Val, Val.Town automatically
infers the name of the Val from your function. Here's we're creating an async
function that accepts an Express.js request and response object.

<IFrame
    src="https://www.val.town/embed/merlin.POSTLikes"
    title="Post Like"
    height={480}
    client:only="react"
/>

You'll also notice the `@username.val` syntax in the code, this is how we can
reference other Vals. The `@me` is a shorthand reference to the current user, in
our case it's equivalent to `@merlin`.

Here you can see we call a Val we created called `@me.auth` which checks the
rate limiting, Origin header and that a device fingerprint is provided in the
expected format.

We also check that the provided slug actually exists in our blog and that the
the req method is what we expect.

Right, now all that's out of the way we can actually persist the data. We can
just grab the state from our KV Val, modify it and re-save it. You can see we're
using `new Set()` and spreading back to an array to ensure our fingerprints are
unique. Finally we can return a 200 success response.

#### GET /likes?postSlug=example

<IFrame
    src="https://www.val.town/embed/merlin.GETLikes"
    title="Get Likes"
    height={382}
    client:only="react"
/>

The `GET` endpoint is pretty simple, we just grab the state from our KV Val and
return it as JSON.

#### Auth

<IFrame
    src="https://www.val.town/embed/merlin.auth"
    title="Auth"
    height={438}
    client:only="react"
/>

Here's a look at our `auth` Val. It also features a good example of how you can
leverage other people in the communities Vals, in this case we're using
`@stevekrouse.rateLimit` to rate limit requests.

#### Validating a post slug is valid

<IFrame
    src="https://www.val.town/embed/merlin.validatePostExists"
    title="validatePostExists"
    height={268}
    client:only="react"
/>

Validating a post slug is valid is a little more involved. My initial plan was
to create a webhook in Val.Town and call this everytime the site is deployed
with a list of valid slugs. This would decrease latency when validating but
digging into CI deploy tasks seemed like a potential rabbit hole so I decided to
just fetch the list of slugs from the blog itself. This means we have to make a
request to the blog every time we validate a slug, but I think that's fine if we
implement optimistic updates in the UI.

On the Astro side of things, this was delightfully easy to setup, I just created
a file in the pages directory that returns a JSON response of all the slugs.

```ts
// /src/pages/posts.json.ts
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

const allBlogPosts = await getCollection("blog", ({ data }) => !data.draft);

export async function get() {
    return {
        body: JSON.stringify(allBlogPosts.map(({ slug }) => slug)),
    };
}
```

## Client side implementation

Finally we can implement the client side code. I won't go into too much detail
here as it's pretty standard React code, but feel free to browse the
[source code](https://github.com/MerlinMason/PersonalSite/blob/main/src/components/LikeButton.tsx)
if you're interested.

```tsx
<LikeButton slug={slug} client:visible />
```

We can include the `LikeButton` component in our blog posts as a dynamic island.
Using Astro's `client:visible` directive we ensure that the scripts for the
island and the API requests are only made as the user scrolls to the island,
reducing the initial page load time.

## Conclusion

So, how was it? I think generally I was impressed with Val.Town, in terms of the
friction of deploying a series of serverless functions it really can't get much
easier than this.

You could achieve the same thing with a similarly low amount of effort with
Vercel's KV store and NextJS, but if you're using an entirely static site like
Astro then Val.Town is a great option.

The editing experience in Val.Town is OK... They have syntax highlight and some
level of autocomplete and linting but it's not as good as VSCode and obviously
lacks something like CoPilot. I did find sometimes when working on multiple Vals
at once the linting would get out of sync and you'd have to refresh the page.
The formatting currently removes line breaks which I find impacts the
readability of the code. It's also not really clear if you have unsaved changes
or not.

The debugging experience is also a little lacking, you can see the logs of your
Vals but you have to go to a different page to see them. It would be nice if you
could see the logs inline with the code.

I also think a highly simplified testing solution would be really handy where
you could provide a range of example inputs and expected outputs.

While there is a [Explore](https://www.val.town/trending) page on their site
it's somewhat limited and the search isn't great. I found I didn't have that
much opportunity to leverage other peoples Vals. At the moment you can't really
differentiate between Vals that are public so the community can reuse them and
Vals that are public but are just for the author to use.

All this being said, it's a new platform and I hear the team are on implementing
all sorts of new features so I'm confident it will improve over time.

There's a growing list of integrations with other platforms too, which may prove
useful. I think the fact you can schedule Vals to run might make it a useful
tool for quick and dirty data gathering and aggregating between platforms, a
problem nearly every startup has.

Amazing concept and I'm excited to see where it goes!

ps, I still love Astro ❤️

pps, Why not give the like button a go? 👇
