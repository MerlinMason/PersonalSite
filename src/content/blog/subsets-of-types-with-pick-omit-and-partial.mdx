In this blog post we're going to look at ways to manage types in a simple todo
list application with the aim of keeping things readable, maintainable and type
safe.

For any model in my applications, I really like typing out a complete model in
one place, this allows it to be read and understood at a glance.

```ts
// Complete model
type ToDo = {
    id: string;
    description: string;
    tags: string[];
    created_at: string;
    status: "todo" | "in_progress" | "done";
};
```

This does present us with some challenges though, as there's plenty of reasons
why you might need to access various subsets of this type. For these subsets we
want inherit from our definition and get some handy warnings if we break
anything.

Luckily TypeScript has some built in utilities to help with this, let's look
through a few different scenarios.

## Picking properties from a type

Ok, so let's say we want to build a component to display the status of a todo.
Here we can use the `Pick` utility to grab a property from the ToDo type. This
gives us autocomplete on our `bgColor` ternary and if at some point in the
future we decided to rename our `done` status to `complete` we'd get a warning
here.

```tsx
type Props = {
    status: Pick<ToDo, "status">; // Just the status from our Todo type
};

const ToDoStatus = ({ status }: Props): JSX.Element => {
    const bgColor = status === "done" ? "bg-green-300" : "bg-gray-300";

    return (
        <span className={`inline-block p-4 rounded ${bgColor}`}>
            {status.replace("_", " ")}
        </span>
    );
};
```

You can also pick multiple properties with the pipe operator:

```ts
type SomeProperties = Pick<ToDo, "status" | "tags">;
```

## Omitting properties from a type

Nice, now let's think about validating the data we're sending to our API for
persistence. When we're creating a todo the backend is going to generate an `id`
and `created_at` timestamps for us, but we do need to send all other properties.
Here we can use the `Omit` utility to remove those but require the rest.

```ts
// All properties except id and created_at
type NewToDo = Omit<ToDo, "id" | "created_at">;

const body: NewToDo = {
    description: "Write a post about Pick and Omit",
    tags: ["blogging"],
    status: "in_progress",
};

await fetch("https://my-api.com/todos", {
    method: "POST",
    body,
});
```

## All properties optional except one

This varies depending on API implementations, but often when sending update
requests to our API we may only want to send the data that has changed rather
than the full model. Technically this is a `PATCH` request, but sometimes APIs
implement `PUT` requests as `PATCH`.

Anyway, here we can combine `Pick` with the `Partial` utility. The `Partial`
utility restricts us to only including properties of `ToDo`, but makes them all
optional.

The end result of combining these is:

1. It forces us to send an `id`.
2. Makes every other property of `ToDo` optional.
3. Does not allow us to add properties that do not exist in the `ToDo` type.

```ts
// All ToDo properties are optional except 'id'
type UpdateTodo = Pick<ToDo, "id"> & Partial<ToDo>;

const id = "example-id";
const body: UpdateTodo = {
    id,
    status: "done", // This could be any other property of ToDo
};

await fetch(`https://my-api.com/todos/${id}`, {
    method: "PATCH",
    body,
});
```

Hopefully these utilities can help you improve how you're managing types in your
applications.
