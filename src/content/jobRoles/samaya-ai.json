  "description": "Working with one of the authors of the <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401' target='_blank'>original RAG paper</a>, we set out to commercialise the research into a product for financial domain experts. As one of the first 10 hires, and the first product-focused engineer, I helped an exceptionally strong AI team (ex-Meta, Google, AWS) move towards product-market fit. Along the way, I contributed to landing the first customers (including Morgan Stanley and leading hedge funds), growing revenue from $0 to 8 figures, and securing a $43M Series A led by NEA."
